# DashMate

[Dash][] integration for [TextMate][].

## Installation

Download the Source code archive from the [latest release][release], unpack and double click DashMate.tmbundle to install.

You will need both [TextMate][] and [Dash][], of course!

## Usage

* `⌃⌥H` to lookup the current word or selection in Dash
* `⌃⌘H` to lookup the current word or selection in Dash, using docsets matching your current scope
	* Customize the used docsets by setting `TM_DASH_KEYWORDS` in your `.tm_properties`
